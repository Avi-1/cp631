# CP 631 - Advanced Parallel Programming
## Group 2 - Final Project

### TODO

* Setup
  * Set up github: DONE
  * Find unit testing framework: Check is simple and os independent https://libcheck.github.io/check/index.html
		 instructions and tutorial are here DONE
* Code
  * Basic Matrix IO functions, DONE
  * Pull image from a file and preprocess output as matrix in text file, DONE
  * Pull matrix from file, DONE
  * Send resultant matrix to text file, DONE
  * Apply convolution to matrix, DONE
  * Convert text grid to image
  
  * Parallelize with both MPI and openMP
  * Spread matrix to relevant processes
  * Collect resultant matrices from the processes
  
  
### In-progress

* Avi
*cuda
*file IO

* Awstin
*MPI debugging and omp

* Elena
*compare kernels to make sure output is the same
*find kernels for edge detection (vertical and horizontal)
*find images for testing
*scripting and testing
